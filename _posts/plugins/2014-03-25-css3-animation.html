<script type="text/javascript" src="../javascripts/plugin_css3_animation_example.js"></script>

<p>
This plugin replaces the animation function of SilverTrack to work with css3 transtions, it will provide an stunning amount of performance for mobile devices and even desktop browsers. Note that due the way css3 animations work the option <em>restart({animate: false})</em> of SilverTrack will not work. It will <em>automatically fallback to javascript animations</em> if transitions are not available in the browser.
</p>

<p>
This plugin requires <em>Moderniz.transform3d</em>. You will find just this feature in the <a href="https://github.com/tulios/jquery.silver_track/blob/master/lib/modernizr.mediaqueries.transforms3d.js">lib directory of SilverTrack repository</a> but you could use your own Modernizr files.
